Noro, a text editor made by yeti0904/MESYETI

Noro has different modes for interacting with the text editor, listed below:
- Standby  - Sends all input to the program, and switches to command mode if you
            press CTRL+K
- Shortcut - Interprets key presses as shortcuts (which are listed later on) and
            switches back to standby mode after the command is done
- Window   - Same as command mode, but has commands specific to windows

Some keybinds will work regardless of the current mode, which are listed below
- CTRL+Q - Exits noro

Note: The keybinds documented below are the default noro keybinds, your config
      may differ

Noro allows you to configure different parts of the editor using the autoexec
file located in HOME/.config/noro/autoexec.noro
You may find that this file is already populated with some configuration
Things you can do with it to customise noro are listed below
Shortcuts
=========
You can define shortcuts by using the shortcut command in the file, it works
like this:
    shortcut \keys\ \action\
The actions are just commands, which are documented later
As for the keys you can add any of these:
- ctrl      - control key modifier
- shift     - shift key modifier (only for non-alpha keys)
- alt       - alt key modifier
- up        - up arrow key
- down      - down arrow key
- left      - left arrow key
- right     - right arrow key
- tab       - tab key
- backspace - backspace key


Noro has commands which (for now) can only be executed through shortcuts
Here's a list of them with what parameters they take:
- window                - Switches the editor to window mode
- maximise              - Maximises the current window
- fullscreen            - Fullscreens the current window
- border                - Toggles the border on the current window
- menu                  - Opens the program menu
- close                 - Closes the current window
- switch                - Moves the bottom window to the top
- shortcut <keys> <cmd> - Defines a new shortcut with the given keys and command
- shortcuts_off         - Disables the shortcut key
- editor                - Opens the text editor in the current window
- theme <theme name>    - Sets the current theme (more info on themes later)

These commands can help to customise how noro is too
For example, you could add the following lines to your autoexec.noro to enable minimal
mode
```
menu
editor
border
fullscreen
shortcuts_off
```
This leaves you with just the editor in fullscreen, with no way to run anything else


Noro's colours are (for the most part) customisable
You can customise these colours using theme files, which are stored in
~/.config/noro/themes
Themes are JSON files containing definitions for each part of the colourscheme
For example, you set the dialog background like this:
```
{
	"dialogBG": "white"
}
```
Here is a list of each property you can set:
- windowFG (for regular windows like the editor or pages)
- windowBG
- dialogFG (for stuff like open/save dialog)
- dialogBG
- background (desktop background colour)
- topbarFG (colour of the top bar)
- topbarBG

And a list of each colour:
- black
- red
- green
- yellow
- blue
- magenta
- cyan
- white
- default
- grey/brightblack
- brightred
- brightgreen
- brightyellow
- brightblue
- brightmagenta
- brightcyan
- brightwhite
